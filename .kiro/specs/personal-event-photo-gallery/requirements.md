# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Personal Event Photo Gallery with Smart Face Recognition is a web-based application that transforms event photo collections into an intelligent, personalized gallery. The system automatically analyzes photos to identify faces, groups them by person, and allows attendees to easily find all photos they appear in through a simple, privacy-first interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an event attendee, I want to quickly find all photos I appear in without browsing through hundreds of images, so that I can easily access and download my photos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor accesses the gallery homepage THEN the system SHALL display face thumbnails labeled as "Person 1", "Person 2", etc.
2. WHEN a visitor clicks on a face thumbnail THEN the system SHALL display all photos containing that person
3. WHEN viewing personalized photos THEN the system SHALL provide download options for each image
4. WHEN browsing photos THEN the system SHALL load images quickly with optimized performance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an event organizer, I want to automatically process and organize photos by faces with minimal manual effort, so that I can provide value to attendees without spending hours sorting photos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN photos are uploaded to the system THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and extract faces from all images
2. WHEN face detection is complete THEN the system SHALL group similar faces together using clustering algorithms
3. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL generate unique identifiers for each person cluster
4. WHEN the gallery is ready THEN the system SHALL provide a clean interface showing all detected person thumbnails

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an event attendee, I want my privacy protected so that I only see photos I appear in and others cannot access my photos without permission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a person accesses their photo collection THEN the system SHALL only display photos containing their face
2. WHEN face clustering occurs THEN the system SHALL not store or expose personal identifying information
3. WHEN photos are processed THEN the system SHALL use anonymous person identifiers rather than names
4. WHEN the system stores face data THEN it SHALL only retain face embeddings necessary for matching

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an event organizer, I want the system to handle various photo formats and sizes efficiently, so that all event photos can be included regardless of camera or device used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN photos are uploaded THEN the system SHALL support common image formats (JPEG, PNG, HEIC)
2. WHEN processing images THEN the system SHALL handle various resolutions and orientations
3. WHEN serving images THEN the system SHALL provide optimized versions for web display
4. WHEN storing images THEN the system SHALL maintain original quality for downloads

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable face recognition accuracy so that attendees can find their photos without missing images or seeing incorrect matches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN detecting faces THEN the system SHALL achieve high accuracy in face detection across different lighting conditions
2. WHEN clustering faces THEN the system SHALL group the same person's faces together with high precision
3. WHEN face matching fails THEN the system SHALL handle edge cases gracefully without system errors
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide confidence metrics for face matches

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an event attendee, I want a responsive and intuitive interface that works on both desktop and mobile devices, so that I can access my photos from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the gallery on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive design that works on small screens
2. WHEN browsing photos THEN the system SHALL provide smooth navigation and image viewing experience
3. WHEN loading the gallery THEN the system SHALL display content quickly with progressive loading
4. WHEN interacting with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback for all actions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an event organizer, I want to deploy and host the gallery easily with reliable performance, so that attendees can access their photos without technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL handle concurrent users accessing the gallery simultaneously
2. WHEN serving images THEN the system SHALL use CDN for fast global access
3. WHEN the gallery is live THEN it SHALL maintain uptime and handle traffic spikes during peak access
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and graceful degradation
